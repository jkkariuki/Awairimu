            Resolution 1: Start planning and saving early
          </h5>

          <p>
            Gina Lorenzo, an agent with RE/MAX Executive in Charlotte, North
            Carolina, says she’s been working since November with clients who
            aren’t looking to purchase until the spring or summer. She calls
            these clients her A-players.
          </p>
          <p>
            “These are my planners,” Lorenzo says. “They fare best when it comes
            to purchasing a home in the upcoming year because they’re doing
            their homework now and getting the basics out of the way.”
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Lorenzo, many factors go into a buyer finding the right
            home, including researching neighborhoods and looking at the market
            to understand what is available within a budget.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There can be a learning curve of what your budget can actually get
            you,” she says. “Sometimes people need to adjust their expectations
            – or their budget.”
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Lorenzo, a mortgage payment is only part of the monthly
            cost of homeownership. There’s also the potential HOA fee, private
            mortgage insurance (typically required with a down payment of less
            than 20%), homeowners insurance and property taxes to consider.
          </p>
          <p>
            “When you add everything to your loan cost and come up with a final
            number, it narrows down your options,” Lorenzo says.
          </p>

          <h5 class='articleHeaders'>
            Resolution 2: Create a (realistic) monthly budget, including a
            potential mortgage payment
          </h5>
          <p>
            Once homebuyers have a feel for how much they are able to afford
            each month, they should work with a mortgage advisor to get
            pre-qualified for a loan that meets their needs and works with what
            they can afford monthly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Getting pre-qualified allows you to know what your budget is before
            you go window shopping,” says Crystal Jenkins, a Sales Associate
            with RE/MAX Downtown in Orlando, Florida. “It’s always good to know
            how much money you have in your pocket to spend.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of other variables can determine how big of a loan makes sense
            for each individual homebuyer, including type of loan (FHA, VA or
            Conventional, for example) or the current interest rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            “A lot of times, people qualify for more than they can afford,”
            Lorenzo says. “You need to look at your finances and determine,
            ‘What do I feel comfortable with?’”
          </p>
          <p>
            A rule of thumb is that housing costs shouldn’t exceed more than
            one-third of a homebuyer’s monthly income.
          </p>

          <h5 class='articleHeaders'>
            Resolution 3: Build a real estate dream team
          </h5>
          <p>
            Buying a first home is exciting and maybe a little intimidating.
            Working with the right real estate agent and mortgage broker can
            make life a lot easier – and more fun. An agent can help a homebuyer
            zero in on the right property during the search process and also
            advocate for homebuyers at the closing table.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Looking for the house is just one step,” Jenkins says. “Once you
            find a house you like, who’s helping you after that? A real estate
            agent is there to help you negotiate the best terms in purchasing a
            home that benefits you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jenkins says buying a home is not a simple DIY project – it’s
            important for homebuyers to work with a trusted advisor. In addition
            to helping buyers in the real estate process, an agent can recommend
            home inspectors, repair services, home warranties and other
            important services.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is the biggest financial transaction of your life, why would
            you want to do it on your own?” says Jenkins “You need to find
            somebody you trust.”
          </p>

          <h5 class='articleHeaders'>
            Resolution 4: Get out more! Start browsing homes and neighborhoods
          </h5>
          <p>
            Once homebuyers have an idea of their ideal price range and have
            found an agent to work with, it’s time to start looking at different
            properties online and in person, potentially even attending an open
            house.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s really hard for people to make a decision about a house if
            they don’t have a point of reference,” Lorenzo says. “Say your
            budget is $500,000. What does $500,000 look like in your area? What
            you don’t want to do is have the first time you’re looking at houses
            be when you’re ready to pull the trigger.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to choosing the right neighborhood, Jenkins says to
            keep in mind three important things: “You have to think about it in
            terms of live, work, play. How close is it to grocery stores? The
            gym? Your work?” she says.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a buyer has a specific neighborhood in mind, Lorenzo stresses the
            importance of working with a professional who specializes in that
            community.
          </p>
          <p>
            “An agent can tell you about everything from traffic patterns to
            community events,” she says. “They may even know about some things
            buyers don’t think about, such as noise from overhead plane
            traffic.”
          </p>

          <h5 class='articleHeaders'>
            Resolution 5: Clean up your credit if possible
          </h5>
          <p>
            Having the opportunity to correct your credit is one way having time
            on your side is important in the home-buying process. It’s another
            reason Jenkins says it’s critical to start early.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            “Three to six months is a good timeline. If you start saving and
            taking steps to correct your credit now, by April you could be ready
            to close on a house in as little as 30 days,” she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Credit bureaus submit a new report each month, according to Jenkins.
            That means homebuyers can see a boost in their credit every 30 days
            as long as they continue to exercise good credit habits.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Prospective homebuyers can take a number of steps to improve or
            maintain their credit score.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            Jenkins advises homebuyers to keep or pay down their credit balance
            to under at least 25% of available credit.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            “Avoid charging a lot on your credit card during the holidays,”
            Jenkins says. “Credit card debt can affect your debt-to-income
            ratio, which is an important consideration during the pre-approval
            process.”
          </p>
          <p></p>

          <h5 class='articleHeaders'>
            Resolution 6: Plan for more than the down payment
          </h5>
          <p>
            In addition to the down payment, homebuyers will also need to pay
            thousands of dollars in closings costs before the deal is final.
            They also may have one final month of rent due at their current
            apartment, need to hire movers, or have to pay for temporary housing
            while waiting to move into the new home.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The more money buyers have in their pocket when making an offer, the
            better shape they’ll be in. A buyer’s mortgage advisor or real
            estate agent can help buyers plan how much their savings goal should
            be.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            The start of a new year is always an exciting time. Staying focused
            on the goals above will help make the homebuying process exciting,
            too!
