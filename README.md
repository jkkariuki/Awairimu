Real Estate Agent Website


This project was built using React-Redux, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.
Users of this application will be able to search for rental and sale properties in a particular area. 
This tool may be useful for Real Estate agents for the purpose of Digital Marketing.

Currently the app is using SAMPLE dummy data provided in the SIMPLY RETS API.

In order for real industry data to be utilized in this app with Simply Rets, a real estate agent/salesperson would
first need to provide credentials(MLS credentials) which would provide access to data in a particular real estate market.

Once the credentials are provided and established Simply Rets can standardize the format of the data in to the same format as the dummy data provided.
The SimplyRETS API makes it easy to access your MLS's listing data from with any programming language.
